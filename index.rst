**Objectives:**

In this course, you will learn how the Web works by writing a Web
server and some Web applications.  More generally, we will discuss
concepts in client-server and peer-to-peer architectures and how all
of this technology works "under the hood" on today's Internet.  We’ll
also discuss issues and approaches to developing software with an eye
to maintainability, and learn about the practical separation of
concerns in Web application stacks, from browser through server.
